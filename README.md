# Consuming-News-Through-Robots
This research explores news consumption through artificial intelligent agents, such as smart speakers or robots. Robots delivering news through various communication styles might impact individuals' trust level in the information provided. Furthermore, various AI agents might impact recall of news knowledge. The findings of this research will offer insights for developing policies or guidelines to ensure AI is used responsibly in the dissemination of news.
